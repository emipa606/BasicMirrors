This mod contains a basic mirror item that allows colonists to slowly train their social skill. It also provides recreation. The mirror costs 40 silver to build and is classified as "medieval" level research. Just a simple little mod!

Notes:

* The mirror does not rotate
* The mirror does not reflect
* This is a basic mirror
* I will be adding a wall-mirror in the future
